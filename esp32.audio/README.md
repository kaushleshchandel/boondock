### STEP 2. Programming the Boondock

After assembling your boondock echo, you need a micro USB cable to program your boondock Echo. [CLICK HERE](/3d.print/README.md) for Assembly instructions and video.

#### Prepare the SD Card

You can use any size SD card and format it to FAT32. I have used a 32GB micro SD card, so I would recommend using the same.

After formatting the card, copy all the files from the folder named **sd_card**

The system folder has some files that are used by boondock Echo. After the boondock starts for the first time, it will create some folders. All the audio files are stored on the SD card.

#### Prepare the IDE to program Boondock Echo.

You can watch the detailed video on setting up Platform IO and Visual Studio code. If you are familiar with visual studio code, open the folder with ESP32 audio code.

Now connect the Boondock Echo using a Micro USB cable, and click upload.

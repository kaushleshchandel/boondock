### What is Boondock Echo?
Boondock Echo is a time-shift audio project created for emergency radio communications. A Boondock Echo module connects to transceivers with audio cables between the mic and speaker of the radio and the speaker and mic of the Bookdock Echo moule. 
The Boondock Echo listens to the radio for traffic. Whenever new traffic is received, it captures the audio as a .mp3 on a local sd card, and then sends the file to sever for storage, and queing, and playback. Users can play back messages on the Boondock browser interface or que messages for transmission on a radio.

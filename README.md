# Bondock Echo

## What is Boondock
Boondock is a project created for emergency radio communications. A boondock module connects to a Ham radio device using a cable to connect mic and speaker to bookdock. Once started, it will listen to radio for messages. Whenever new messages are received, it captures the audio, converts it to an audio file, and sends it to sever for queue. The message can be played back on the boondock server interface. The sever interface lets you queue multiple messages to be played back to the radio.

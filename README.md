### What is Boondock Echo?
Boondock Echo is a time-shift audio project created for emergency radio communications. A Boondock Echo module connects to transceivers with audio cables between the audio input and output of the radio and the audio output and input of the Bookdock Echo module, respectively. 

The Boondock Echo listens to the radio for transmissions. Whenever new transmission is received, it captures the audio to a wave (.wav) file recording onto attached sd card, and then sends the file to server for storage, queuing, and playback. Users can play back messages on the Boondock browser interface or queue messages for re-transmission on a radio.

Having the connection between local radio and cloud enables us to add some really nifty features to a radio, that were not possible earlier. For example, converting audio to text, using text to speech, audio noise reduction, and other audio pre- and post-processing.
